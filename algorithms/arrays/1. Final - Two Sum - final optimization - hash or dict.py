# Approach: Only search Arr[indx+1:] for complement to reduce search complexity
# Further optimization options: 
#     a) Use dictionary Implement Hash in python so that the index search is optimized to constant time. Blogs suggest .index() has complexity of O(n)
#     b) keep it neat & store values in variables if you're accessing them more than once eg .index()
