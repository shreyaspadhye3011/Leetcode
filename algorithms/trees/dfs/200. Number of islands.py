# Reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/
# Approach:
# 1. Get a list of all locations that have 1 
# 2. Iterate through this list and call DFS for every unmarked / unvisited 1 and mark all it's reachable locations with the current_island_count
# 3. The final value of current_island_count is the answer

# Status: basic test case working.
# Issue with: 
# obj.numIslands([["1","1","0","0","0"],["1","1","0","0","0"],["0","0","1","0","0"],["0","0","0","1","1"]])   # o: 3
# When submitting, leetcode shows my solution as 2, whereas execution in jupyter or even leetcode interactive shows answer as 3?
# Strange! post on forums and understand

# optimization: land_locations can be a dictionary instead of a list and then you use the sane for visited_dict functionality and find and remove keys (land_locations) whenever they are marked. So you do not have to go through the whole thing of retrieving next land_location and checking whether it's visited. You can be sure that land_locations at all times maintains the unvisited locations due to the removal procedure of newighbours

# Interesting Pointer:
# When local variable islandCount was used, Test Case 2 had issues. Possibly because the local parameter was colliding. Strange but true.
# Whereas, when class variable used, it worked perfectly. REM: When you have one value being updated by multiple objects or function calls (here recursive calls), use class variable
# (switching between 2 & 3. Error only happened when string "1" used)    
# Possibly due to the way the for loop and recursive calls are interlocked.
