# TODO: Add more pointers from Interview Prep keeo note

## Mindset
1. It's a discussion. 
2. Even if you're struggling, don't hold off from sharing some insightful ideas. They want to see how you problem solve. How you communicate
3. **Ask for hints when stuck. It's fine. It's better than bombing the interview. It tells the interviewer that you do ask for help when you know it isn't going anywhere. It's a good sign!

## Code
# [BIG] [IMP] Realized that understanding questions is crucial. 
1. Spend time understanding the question. 
2. Draw it out on paper + chalk out a few test cases. That will come in handy when you're writing code
3. Code can be written in 10-15 minutes if you write clean code and understand the question really well.
4. [IMP] Always aim for a working solution first and then optimization
5. Write clean, abstracted code
6. Write pseudo code / abstracted code and then fill in details (create functions and directly use. can fill in body later)
